# Using pre-trained Model for improving performance
#### summary:
In previous work i used a neural network architecture that was designed by myself.
here i tried using a pre-traind neural network called efficientnet_b0 to improve last results.
first all first trained layers were freezed ,then tried traning outputlayers(the classifier) using our data.
the new model accuracy and loss were calculated and plotted.
#### results:
results showed a little bite improving, especially in training set and a better convergence.
